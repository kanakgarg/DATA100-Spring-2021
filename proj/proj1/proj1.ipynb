This can be due to the fact that many give out a 100 instead of a 99, thus due to the scoring process we have affinities for some values and not others.Another thing to notice is how the count levels off as the scores get lower. This could be due to lower scored restaurants going out of business."

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](pics/7d.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Use `second_score` and `first_score` created in the scatter plot code above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Convert the scores into numpy arrays to make them easier to deal with.\n",
